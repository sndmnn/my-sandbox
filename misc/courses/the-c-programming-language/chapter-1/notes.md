"C" as its referred to commonly is the combination between the C Programming Language and the C Standard Library.

The language does not provide any native feature to allocate storage outside the stack or static definitions. It also does not provide any native features to work with input/output. Such "higher-level" features are provided by the Standard Library.

The first definition of C was the reference manual in the first edition of the book "The C Programming Language", but the modern definition of C is maintained by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and that's where "ANSI C" comes from.
